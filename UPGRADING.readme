MySQL

  The MySQL schema has changed since PhpWiki 1.2.0.

  If you're upgrading from PhpWiki 1.2.0 and you use the MySQL back end,
  you need to update the schema.

  As long as you use the stock table names you can just do something like:

    mysql -u <username> -p wiki < schemas/update.mysql.1.2.0-1.2.1

  If you don't use the stock table names, look at the script in
  schemas/update.mysql.1.2.0-1.2.1 and use it as a guide.
