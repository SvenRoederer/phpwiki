More comprehensive updgrading information is forthcoming... however in
the meantime, this message is in the Open Discussion board on
Sourceforge (see URL below for the thread). In it Jeff describes how
to dump your current Wiki to a zip file and load the zip file into a
new Wiki.

Yes this is a little clumsy and non-obvious.
I'm currently working on making it better (at least
in the development branch.)

In the mean time, here's how I suggest you

Get either a zip dump, or a serialized dump from your
old wiki.

(If your using a zip dump, it must (for now) be
on the server machine.  Copy it there if it's not
there yet.)

Edit lib/config.php in the new wiki and set WIKI_PGSRC
to point either to your zip file, or the the serialized
dump directory.

Blow away the database of your new wiki.
(Delete the db files for a db base wiki,
or do something like:
  mysql -u <user> -p <database> < schemas/schema.mysql
to blow away a mysql based wiki.

Now with your web browser, go browse to
the HomePage of your new wiki.  It will detect
that it's working with a virgin database and
will pull in the pages from the source
specified in WIKI_PGSRC.

Jeff
