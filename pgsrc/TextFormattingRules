'''Paragraphs'''

	* Don't Indent paragraphs

	* Words wrap and fill as needed

	* Use blank lines as separators

	* Four or more minus signs make a horizontal rule

	* %%''''% makes a linebreak (in headings and lists too)


'''Lists'''

	* tab-* for first level

		* tab-tab-* for second level, etc.

	* Use * for bullet lists, 1. for numbered lists (mix at will)

	* tab-Term:-tab Definition for definition lists

	* One line for each item

	* Other leading whitespace signals preformatted text, changes font.


'''Headings'''

	* '!' at the start of a line makes a small heading

	* '!!' at the start of a line makes a medium heading 

	* '!!!' at the start of a line makes a large heading


'''Fonts'''
	* Indent with one or more spaces to use a monospace font:

 This is in monospace
This is not


'''Indented Paragraphs'''
''(Quotes)''

	* tab-space-:-tab -- often used (with emphasis) for quotations.  (See SimulatingQuoteBlocks)


'''Emphasis'''

	* Use doubled single-quotes ('') for emphasis (usually italics)

	* Use tripled single-quotes (''') for strong emphasis (usually bold)

	* Use five single-quotes ('''''), or triples within doubles, for some other kind of emphasis (BoldItalicInWiki), but be careful about the bugs in the Wiki emphasis logic...

	* Emphasis can be used multiple times within a line, but cannot cross line boundaries


'''References'''
	* Hyperlinks to other pages within the Wiki are made by placing the page name in square brackets: [this is a page link]

	* Hyperlinks to external pages are done like this: [http://www.wcsb.org/]

	* You can name the links to the external pages by providing a name, a bar (|) and then the hyperlink: [Steve's home page | http://wcsb.org/~swain/]  

	* Old Wiki linking is still supported: JoinCapitalizedWords to make local references

	* You can suppress linking to old-style references by preceeding the word with a '!', e.g. !NotLinkedAsWikiName

	* [1], [2], [3], [4] refer to remote references. Click EditLinks on the edit form to enter URLs. These differ from the newer linking scheme; references are unique to a page.

	* Also, the old way of linking URL's is still supported: precede URLs with "http:", "ftp:" or "mailto:" to create links automatically as in: http://c2.com/

	* URLs ending with .png are inlined ''if inserted as a remote reference'' 


'''Mark-Up Language'''

	* Don't bother

	* < and > are themselves

	* The & characters will not work

	* If you really must use HTML, start each line with a bar (|). Note that this featured must be enabled by the system administrator.
