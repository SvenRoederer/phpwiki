''"Wiki wiki"'' means "quick" in Hawai'ian.

'''All you really need to know is:'''

	* To edit any page click on the Edit Text link at the bottom of
the page. You should do that right now, and read the source code of this
page. It will make more sense.
	* You get italics by surrounding words with two single quotes on
either side ''like this''.
	* You get '''bold text''' by using three quotes on either side.
	* And, '''''bold italics''''' with five.
	* You get bullets by using a tab and an asterick *
	* If you use Windows, you can't use your tab key. It's Bill
Gates's fault. But you can check the little box that says Convert Spaces
To Tabs. You can type a bunch of spaces and the Wiki will recognize them
as a tab.
	* To have plain monospaced font, indent with a space:

 this is a poem 
 about monospacing
 nothing rhymes with poem
 nothing rhymes with monospacing

	* You can seperate paragraphs with an extra blank line. Example:

I am a paragraph.

I am a paragraph too. We're just very small paragraphs.


	* You can get horizontal rules with four or more dashes like this:

	* To create hyperlinks you just capitalize the words and string them together. Let's say you want to create a page about how Steve Wainstead eats worms. All you have to do is capitalize each word and string them together like this: SteveWainsteadEatsWorms. If the page does not exist yet a question mark appears after the link, inviting you to create the page: ThisPageShouldNotExist. (And please don't ruin the example by creating one.) 
	* To link to pages outside the Wiki, you can just type in the URL and Wiki will link it for you: http://www.nytimes.com/
	* Now you are ready to begin AddingPages.

A WikiWikiWeb is meant to be fast and easy to edit. It has very simple markup that you can read about in TextFormattingRules.
