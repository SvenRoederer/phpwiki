<?plugin-form TitleSearch?> |
  <?plugin-form TitleSearch case_exact=1 buttontext=Case-exact ?>

Use the following for a full text search. This takes a few seconds.
The results will show all lines on a given page which contain a
match.

<?plugin-form FullTextSearch?> |
  <?plugin-form FullTextSearch case_exact=1 buttontext=Case-exact ?>

In a fuzzy pages search the titles of all pages are examined to find
those which are similarly spelled or similar sounding (english).

<?plugin-form FuzzyPages ?>

! Tips
Separate words with a space. All words have to match.
%%%To exclude words from a title search or full text search, prepend
a '-'.
%%%Example: 'wiki text -php' looks for all pages containing the words
'wiki' __and__ 'text', but __not__ containing the word 'php'.
