This is a description of the database interface for PhpWiki. Regardless
of what kind of data store is used (RDBMS, DBM files, flat text files)
you should be able to write a library that supports that data store.

A few notes: 

* While most functions specify a "db reference" as the first value
  passed in, this can be any kind of data type that your functions
  know about. For example, in the DBM implementation this is an
  integer that refers to an open database handle, but in the MySQL
  version it's an associative array that contains the DB information.

* Functions that return the page data must return a hash (associative
  array) of all the data, where 'text' == the text of the page in Wiki
  markup, 'version' is an integer representing the version, 'author'
  the IP address or host name of the previous author and so on. See
  the source code for the full listing.


      OpenDataBase($dbname)
      takes:   a string, the name of the database
      returns: a reference to the database (a handle)


      CloseDataBase($dbi)
      takes:   a reference to the database (handle)
      returns: the value of the close


      RetrievePage($dbi, $pagename)
      takes:   db reference, string which is the name of a page
      returns: a PHP associative array containing the page data
	       (text, version, prvious author, etc)


      InsertPage($dbi, $pagename, $pagehash)
      takes:   db reference, page name (string), associative array
	       of all page data
      returns: nothing (hmm. It should probably return true/false)


      IsWikiPage($dbi, $pagename)
      takes:   db reference, string containing page name
      returns: true or false, if the page already exists


      InitTitleSearch($dbi, $search)
      takes:   db reference, search string
      returns: a hash with two keys:
		 'search' -- the search string passed in
		 'key'    -- the first page name returned from the database


      TitleSearchNextMatch($dbi, &$pos)
      takes:   db reference, reference to a hash created by
               InitTitleSearch
      returns: the next page name that contains a match to the search term


      InitFullSearch($dbi, $search)
      takes:   db reference, string containing search term
      returns: this calls InitTitleSearch and returns that result


      FullSearchNextMatch($dbi, &$pos)
      takes:   db reference, reference to a hash created by
               InitFullSearch
      returns: an associative array, where:
		  'name' -- contains the page name
		  'hash' -- contains the hash of the page data
