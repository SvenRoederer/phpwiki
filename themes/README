*The default theme must always be present,* even when using another
theme! Wherever a theme has no specific variant (override) of a
template or image, PhpWiki will look for one in the default theme.

See doc/Themes for more info on PhpWiki themes.

Brief Example of Creating Your Own Theme

To create or modify one of the existing themes:
* Make a copy of one of the themes.
* Look through the default theme, and for any of those templates you
  want to modify, duplicate them in your new theme folder with the
  same directory structure and modify them there instead of the
  originals.

Note:
If you base your theme on the default theme instead of one of the
others, you can safely delete any files you DID NOT modify from the
original (so long as you keep the default theme!).

Review the themeinfo.php for any necessary changes, and add the name
of your theme to index.php.
