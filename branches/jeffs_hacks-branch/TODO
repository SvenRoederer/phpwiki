Full text search will return all pages when searching for "eat" 
because it matches "created." (In a DBM-based installation). This
should be corrected.

Edit copy: A user who makes edits and saves them can no longer access
the copy in the archive. They should be at least allowed to retrieve it.

Write/proofread pages on wiki markup

Add lastmodified and created features to DBM version

In wiki_msql.php3, when strings are decomposed, a single word longer than
MSQL_MAX_LINE_LENGTH will have unknown consequences.

Changes to the default pages (like the change in how Search and
FullSearch are identified, and the right code swapped in) do not
propagate when one updates from CVS since they are in the database
already. This is a "gotcha" and perhaps the only solution is to mention
it in the FAQ and the README.

Also, it might be time to start a FAQ.

Search tells you how many matches it found in how many pages, but it
doesn't say how many pages it searched anymore.

The History list in the browser no longer tells you where an edit page
is; this happened when we switched to templating.
