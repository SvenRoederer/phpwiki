Arno Hollosi wrote the MySQL library, the templates, and wrote the 
finished version of the database schema, plus many other things too
numerous to mention.

Jeff Dairiki <dairiki@dairiki.org> wrote the diff code, among other
things.

Jeremie Kass <jeremie@umich.edu> contributed a patch so the logo is 
decided in the templates instead of being hardcoded.
