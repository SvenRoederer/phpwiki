Full text search will return all pages when searching for "eat" 
because it matches "created." (In a DBM-based installation). This
should be corrected.

Edit copy: A user who makes edits and saves them can no longer access
the copy in the archive. They should be at least allowed to retrieve it.

Wiki porting: it should be easy to write a function that serializes all
pages to files, and allows the user to reload them in another database.
This way it would be easy to move from DBM to a RDBMS.
