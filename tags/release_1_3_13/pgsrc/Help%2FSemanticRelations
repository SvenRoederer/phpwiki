The PhpWiki:SemanticWeb implementation follows closely the [semediawiki
| http://ontoworld.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki] implementation. It features:

* Annotation of article-article-links by means of configurable relations (link-types).
* Annotation of articles with simple data-values that are assigned to configurable attributes.
* Support for using physical units of measurement in all numerical attributes, without need 
  for prior configuration.

The annotation data will be combined with annotations from the current
category system to generate standard-compliant OWL/RDF output, which
can be fully processed with tools that support OWL DL or OWL Lite, but
which can also be treated in a meaningful way by software that
supports RDF, RDFS or XML.

! Relations

Relations (link-types) are defined as link with the following markup
syntax:
<verbatim>
  relation::pagename
</verbatim>

! Attributes

Attributes are defined as link with the following markup syntax:

<verbatim>
  attribute:=value
</verbatim>

Attributes and relations refer only to the current page - the
current page is the subject, the relation the predicate, the linked page the
object in a RDF triple. Relations always refer to another page - they
must not exist. Attributes not, since they are numeric only.

With the SemanticSearch feature you can query online simple and
complex facts.

You can import and export _lists of facts or queries_, as format rdf,
rdfs, owl.

! Example

<em>Sample taken from http://ontoworld.org/wiki/San_Diego, see also

<verbatim>
San Diego [is_a::city] located in the southwestern corner of
