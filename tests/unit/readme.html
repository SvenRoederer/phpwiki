<h1>Introduction</h1>

This directory contains unit tests for PhpWiki.  You must have <a
href="http://pear.php.net/package/PHPUnit">PEAR's PHPUnit package</a>.
These tests are unrelated to maketest.pl in the directory above this
one, which do not use PHPUnit.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<h2>PHP</h2>

You might want to run these from the php <a
href="http://us3.php.net/features.commandline">command-line
interface</a>.  It was experimental as of PHP 4.2.0 (php-cli), default as of PHP
4.3.0.

You also need the 'pear' executable to install or update the required pear libraries.

<h2>PHPUnit</h2>

You can use pear to see if PHPUnit is installed:

<pre>
/export/scratch/apache/2.0.46/php/bin) % ./pear list

If it is not installed, you can use 'pear' to install it:

<pre>
/export/scratch/apache/2.0.46/php/bin) % ./pear install PHPUnit
</pre>

<h1>Running these unit tests</h1>

You must be in the phpwiki/tests/unit subdirectory.  Then use the php
command-line executable to run the tests.  For example:

<pre>
phpwiki/tests/unit % ./test.php
Run tests ..
ran 8 tests, 0 failures.
</pre>

Or for only some tests, give the test names on the commandline:

<pre>
phpwiki/tests/unit % php -Cq test.php SetupWiki DumpHtml
Run tests .. Array
(
    [0] => SetupWiki
    [1] => DumpHtml
)
Purge the testbox .. ran 4 tests, 0 failures.
</pre>

Or run it from the browser like this:

<pre>
http://localhost/phpwiki/test/unit/test.php?tests=SetupWiki,DumpHtml
</pre>
