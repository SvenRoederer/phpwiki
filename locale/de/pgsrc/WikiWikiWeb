A WikiWikiWeb is a site where everyone can collaborate on the content. The most well-known and widely used Wiki is the Portland Pattern Repository at http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?WikiWikiWeb.

I found these statements there particularly relevant:

''The point is to make the EditText form simple and the SeiteFinden search fast.''

''In addition to being quick, this site also aspires to Zen ideals generally labeled WabiSabi. Zen finds beauty in the imperfect and ephemeral. When it comes down to it, that's all you need.''

You can say hello on GaesteBuch, or read about WieManWikiBenutzt and SeitenErzeugen. Currently this Wiki has no "theme" for discussion, so go ahead and play with it and have fun!
