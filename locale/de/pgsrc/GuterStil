"Young writers often suppose that style is a garnish for the meat of

prose, a sauce by which a dull dish is made palatable. Style has no such

separate entity; it is nondetachable, unfilterable. The beginner should

approach style warily, realizing that it is himself he is approaching, no

other; and he should begin by turning resolutely away from all devices

that are popularly believed to indicate style--all mannerisms, tricks,

adornments. The approach to style is by way of plainness, simplicity,

orderliness, sincerity."

English students, unknowingly extols some virtues of WabiSabi''
