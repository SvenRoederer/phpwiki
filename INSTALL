0. INSTALLATION

Untar/gzip this file into the directory where you want it to live.
That's it. To improve efficiency, edit wiki_config.php3 and set the
$ServerAddress by hand; this will save a regexp call on every invocation.

bash$ gzip -d phpwiki-X.XX.tar.gz
bash$ tar xvf phpwiki-X.XX.tar

Let's say you own the web server http://www.foo.com/. You untar in the
server's root directory; then you should be able to just go to your new
Wiki:

http://www.foo.com/wiki/index.php3

If you configure your server to recognize index.php3 as the index of a
directory, you can just do:

http://www.foo.com/wiki/


1. CONFIGURATION

PhpWiki will create two DBM files in /tmp. One contains the pages of the
live site and the other has the archived pages.

If you don't want the DBM files to live in /tmp you must make sure the web
server can read/write to it.  It's probably a bad idea to leave it in
/tmp. (Again, edit wiki_config.php3). 

For example, you create a subdirectory called "pages" in the wiki
directory made when you untarred PhpWiki. Move the DBM files there, and do 

bash$ chmod 666 wikidb wikiarchive

so your web server can read/write the DBM files. Then you must do

bash$ chmod 777 pages

on the "pages" directory to make sure the server can also create/set 
the lock file (PHP has a built in locking mechanism for DBM file access).

The first time you run this Wiki it will load a set of basic pages from
the pgsrc/ directory. These should be enough to get your Wiki started!


2. ALLOWING EMBEDDED HTML

PhpWiki ships with this featured disabled by default. According to CERT 
(http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html) malicious users can embed
HTML in your pages that allow pure evil to happen. You can uncomment the 
"elseif" in wiki_display.php3 to allow embedded HTML; but you should never
do this if your Wiki is publically accessible.


3. ETC

Installing PHP is beyond the scope of this document :-)
You should visit http://www.php.net/ if you don't have PHP.
Note that I have the web server configured to allow index.php3
as the root document of a directory.

This web application was written under PHP version 3.0.12. I used
a very generic installation, so hopefully you will have no problems.
The development platform is a Redhat Linux 4.2 box.

That should be all. Send patches, bugs etc. to swain@wcsb.org.
