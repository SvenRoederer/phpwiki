Here are some good starting points for browsing.

* HowToUseWiki gives you the quick lowdown on Wiki markup.
* RecentChanges recorded automatically.
* MoreAboutMechanics of browsing and editing on this server.

Here's a title search. Try something like <tt>wiki or sandwich</tt>.

<?plugin WikiFormRich action=TitleSearch method=GET nobr=1 class=wikiaction
  editbox[] name=s text=""
  submit[]
  checkbox[] name=case_exact
  pulldown[] name=regex value="auto,none,glob,posix,pcre" ?>

Use the following for a full text search. This takes a few seconds.
The results will show all lines on a given page which contain a
match.

<?plugin WikiFormRich action=FullTextSearch method=GET nobr=1 class=wikiaction
  editbox[] name=s text=""
  submit[]
  checkbox[] name=case_exact
  pulldown[] name=regex value="auto,none,glob,posix,pcre" ?>

In a fuzzy pages search the titles of all pages are examined to find
those which are similarly spelled or similar sounding (english).

<?plugin-form FuzzyPages ?>

! Tips
Separate words with a space. All words have to match as substrings. %%%
Some glob-style wildcard characters are also supported. %%%
To exclude words from a title search or full text search, prepend a '-'. %%%
Use '^xx' or 'xx*' to match words starting with 'xx'. %%%
Use '~*xx' or 'xx$' to match words ending with 'xx'. %%%
Use '^word$' to match exact words. %%%
Use regex=auto and 're:' like 're:word.*xx' or regex=posix to use posix regular expressions. (not yet) %%%
Use regex=auto and '//' like '/^word$/' or regex=pcre to match using perl-style regular expressions.

Example: 'wiki text -php' looks for all pages containing the words 'wiki' and 'text',  %%%
         but not containing the word 'php'.
