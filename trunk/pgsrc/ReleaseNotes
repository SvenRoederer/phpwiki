PhpWiki was written because I am so interested in WikiWikiWebs, and I haven't used PHP since version 2.0. I wanted to see how it had advanced.

Version 1.0 is a near-perfect clone of the Portland Pattern Repository, http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?WikiWikiWeb. In truth, I was using the Wiki script you can download from there as a model; that Wiki lacks a number of features the PPR has, like EditCopy. So in truth PhpWiki is a kind of hybrid of the PPR and the generic Wiki you can get from there (which is written in Perl).

The one caveat of PhpWiki is the allowance of HTML if the line is preceded by a bar (or pipe, which is how I usually say it). (That's a '|'). It was very simple to add, and the idea came from a posting somewhere on the PPR about how AT&T had an internal Wiki clone and used the same technique. The ability to embed HTML is disabled by default for security reasons.

Version 1.01 includes a patch that fixes a small error with rendering <hr> lines. Thanks to Gerry Barksdale.

See the HISTORY file for a rundown on the whole development process if that sort of thing really interests you :-)
