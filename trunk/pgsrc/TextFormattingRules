'''Paragraphs'''

* Don't indent paragraphs
* Words wrap and fill as needed
* Use blank lines as separators
* Four or more minus signs make a horizontal rule
* %%''''% makes a linebreak (in headings and lists too)


'''Lists'''

* asterick for first level
** asterick-asterick for second level, etc.
* Use * for bullet lists, # for numbered lists (mix at will)
* semicolon-term-colon-definition for definition lists:
;term here:definition here, as in the <DL><DT><DD> list
* One line for each item
* Other leading whitespace signals preformatted text, changes font.

'''Headings'''

* '!' at the start of a line makes a small heading
* '!!' at the start of a line makes a medium heading 
* '!!!' at the start of a line makes a large heading

'''Fonts'''
* Indent with one or more spaces to use a monospace font:

 This is in monospace
This is not

'''Indented Paragraphs'''
''(Quotes)''

* semicolon-colon -- works like <BLOCKQUOTE>

;: this is an indented block of text

'''Emphasis'''

* Use doubled single-quotes ('') for emphasis (usually ''italics'')
* Use doubled underscores (__) for strong emphasis (usually __bold__)
* Mix them at will: ''__bold italics__''
* ''Emphasis'' can be used ''multiple'' times within a line, but ''cannot'' cross line boundaries:

''this
will not work''

'''References'''
* Hyperlinks to other pages within the Wiki are made by placing the page name in square brackets: [this is a page link] or UsingWikiWords (preferred)
* Hyperlinks to external pages are done like this: [http://www.wcsb.org/]
* You can name the links to the external pages by providing a name, a bar (|) and then the hyperlink: [PhpWiki home page | http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/]  
* You can suppress linking to old-style references by preceeding the word with a '!', e.g. !NotLinkedAsWikiName
* [1], [2], [3], [4] refer to remote references. Click EditLinks on the edit form to enter URLs. These differ from the newer linking scheme; references are unique to a page.
* Also, the old way of linking URL's is still supported: precede URLs with "http:", "ftp:" or "mailto:" to create links automatically as in: http://c2.com/
* URLs ending with .png, .gif, or .jpg are inlined if in square brackets, by themselves: [http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/images/png.png]


'''HTML Mark-Up Language'''

* Don't bother
* < and > are themselves
* The & characters will not work
* If you really must use HTML, your system administrator can enable this feature. Start each line with a bar (|). Note that this feature is disabled by default.
