'''Indented Paragraphs'''
''(Quotes)''

	* tab-space-:-tab -- often used (with emphasis) for quotations.  (See SimulatingQuoteBlocks)



'''Emphasis'''

	* Use doubled single-quotes ('') for emphasis (usually italics)

	* Use tripled single-quotes (''') for strong emphasis (usually bold)

	* Use five single-quotes ('''''), or triples within doubles, for some other kind of emphasis (BoldItalicInWiki), but be careful about the bugs in the Wiki emphasis logic...

	* Emphasis can be used multiple times within a line, but cannot cross line boundaries



'''References'''

	* JoinCapitalizedWords to make local references

	* [1], [2], [3], [4] refer to remote references. Click EditLinks on the edit form to enter URLs

'''Mark-Up Language'''

	* Don't bother

	* < and > are themselves

	* The & characters will not work

	* If you really must use HTML, start each line with a bar (|). Note that this featured must be enabled by the system administrator.
