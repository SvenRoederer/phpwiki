This is a description of the database interface for PhpWiki. Regardless
of what kind of data store is used (RDBMS, DBM files, flat text files)
you should be able to write a library that supports that data store.

A few notes: 

* While most functions specify a "db reference" as the first value
  passed in, this can be any kind of data type that your functions
  know about. For example, in the DBM implementation this is an
  integer that refers to an open database handle, but in the MySQL
  version it's an associative array that contains the DB information.

* Functions that return the page data must return a hash (associative
  array) of all the data, where 'content' == the text of the page in Wiki
  markup, 'version' is an integer representing the version, 'author'
  the IP address or host name of the previous author and so on. See
  the next paragraph for a precise description.

* The data structure. This is commonly named $pagehash in the source
  code; it's an associative array with values that are integers,
  strings and arrays (i.e. a heterogenous data structure). Here's a
  current description:

  $pagehash = {
     author       => string,
     content      => array (where each element is a line of the page),
     created      => integer (a number in Unix time since the Epoch),
     flags        => integer,
     lastmodified => integer (also Unix time),
     pagename     => string,
     version      => integer,
     refs         => array (where each element is a reference)
  };

The functions are:

      OpenDataBase($dbname)
      takes:   a string, the name of the database
      returns: a reference to the database (a handle)


      CloseDataBase($dbi)
      takes:   a reference to the database (handle)
      returns: the value of the close. For databases with persistent
               connections, this doesn't return anything.


      RetrievePage($dbi, $pagename)
      takes:   db reference, string which is the name of a page
      returns: a PHP associative array containing the page data
	       (text, version, author, etc)


      InsertPage($dbi, $pagename, $pagehash)
      takes:   db reference, page name (string), associative array
	       of all page data
      returns: nothing (hmm. It should probably return true/false)


      IsWikiPage($dbi, $pagename)
      takes:   db reference, string containing page name
      returns: true or false, if the page already exists


      InitTitleSearch($dbi, $search)
      takes:   db reference, search string
      returns: a handle to identify the query and the current position
               within the result set.


      TitleSearchNextMatch($dbi, &$pos)
      takes:   db reference, reference to a hash created by
               InitTitleSearch
      returns: the next page name that contains a match to the search term
               (advances $pos to next result field as well)


      InitFullSearch($dbi, $search)
      takes:   db reference, string containing search term
      returns: similar to InitTitleSearch: a handle to identify the
               query and the current position within the result set.


      FullSearchNextMatch($dbi, &$pos)
      takes:   db reference, reference to a hash created by
               InitFullSearch
      returns: an associative array, where:
		  'name' -- contains the page name
		  'hash' -- contains the hash of the page data
               (advances $pos to next result field as well)


      IncreaseHitCount($dbi, $pagename)
      takes: db reference, string (name of a page)
      returns: nothing (MySQL implementation returns the last result
               set but it is not used by the caller)
	       

      GetHitCount($dbi, $pagename)
      takes: db reference, string (page name)
      returns: an integer, the number of hits the page has received


      InitMostPopular($dbi, $limit)
      takes: a db reference and an integer, which is the limit of the
             number of pages you want returned.
      returns: the result set from the query


      MostPopularNextMatch($dbi, $res)
      takes: db reference, the result set returned by InitMostPopular
      returns: the next row from the result set, as a PHP array type

      GetAllWikiPageNames($dbi)
      GetWikiPageLinks($dbi, $pagename)
      SetWikiPageLinks($dbi, $pagename, $linklist)
