To add a new page to Wiki, all you have to do is come up with a meaningful title, capatalize all the words and StringThemTogetherLikeThis. Wiki automagically recognizes it as a hyperlink.

Then you can go ahead and ClickTheQuestionMark at the end of your new hyperlink, and the Wiki will give you a window for making the new page.

If you wish to add documents with complex markup to the Wiki, you might be better off providing a URL to it than trying to add the text of the document here, like so:

 PhpWiki project homepage: http://wcsb.org/~swain/php/wiki/

The Wiki does not support HTML tags (see TextFormattingRules).  <tags>They will just render like text.</tags> Wiki is meant to be as simple as possible to encourage use.

Note that there is a feature that your system administrator can enable to allow embedded HTML, but there are security risks involved.
