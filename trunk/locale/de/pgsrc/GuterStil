"Young writers often suppose that style is a garnish for the meat of
prose, a sauce by which a dull dish is made palatable. Style has no such
separate entity; it is nondetachable, unfilterable. The beginner should
approach style warily, realizing that it is himself he is approaching, no
other; and he should begin by turning resolutely away from all devices
that are popularly believed to indicate style--all mannerisms, tricks,
adornments. The approach to style is by way of plainness, simplicity,
orderliness, sincerity."

English students, unknowingly extols some virtues of WabiSabi''
