Full text search will return all pages when searching for "eat" 
because it matches "created." (In a DBM-based installation). This
should be corrected.

Edit copy: A user who makes edits and saves them can no longer access
the copy in the archive. They should be at least allowed to retrieve it.

Modify the date functionality so it is based on Unix time; the Postgresql 
InsertPage() will hardcode the date for now.

The 'archive' table has to have the same columns as the 'wiki' table
if we are to use the same InsertPage() function on both. 

Wiki porting: it should be easy to write a function that serializes all
pages to files, and allows the user to reload them in another database.
This way it would be easy to move from DBM to a RDBMS.
