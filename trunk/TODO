Security fix needed: the info page allows the user to enter arbitrary 
HTML.

Full text search will return all pages when searching for "eat" 
because it matches "created." (In a DBM-based installation). This
should be corrected.

Edit copy: A user who makes edits and saves them can no longer access
the copy in the archive. They should be at least allowed to retrieve it.

Wiki porting: it should be easy to write a function that serializes all
pages to files, and allows the user to reload them in another database.
This way it would be easy to move from DBM to a RDBMS.

Write/proofread pages on wiki markup

Add a TestPage which tests all markup features: wikinames, external
links, lists, and other markup

Add lastmodified and created features to DBM version

In wiki_msql.php3, when strings are decomposed, a single word longer than
MSQL_MAX_LINE_LENGTH will have unknown consequences.

Changes to the default pages (like the change in how Search and
FullSearch are identified, and the right code swapped in) do not
propagate when one updates from CVS since they are in the database
already. This is a "gotcha" and perhaps the only solution is to mention
it in the FAQ and the README.

Also, it might be time to start a FAQ.

Search tells you how many matches it found in how many pages, but it
doesn't say how many pages it searched anymore.
