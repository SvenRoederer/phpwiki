Jan Nieuwenhuizen <janneke@gnu.org> contributed a major patch to
supply default pages in Dutch; this led to an architecture to support
internationalization, and PhpWiki can now accomodate pages in any
language.

Neil Brown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au> has contributed numerous useful
patches for the 1.1.8 release.

Aredridel Niothke     <aredridel@nbtsc.org> has started a flat file
database for Phpwiki, which is included in the 1.1.8 release.

Arno Hollosi wrote the MySQL library, the templates, and wrote the 
finished version of the database schema, plus many other things too
numerous to mention.

Jeff Dairiki <dairiki@dairiki.org> wrote the diff code and a complete
rewrite of PhpWiki using PHP classes.

Jeremie Kass <jeremie@umich.edu> contributed a patch so the logo is 
decided in the templates instead of being hardcoded.
